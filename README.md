# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Recognition project! ðŸŽ‰ This project leverages deep learning to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Itâ€™s a great example of how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to classify images with impressive accuracy.

## Whatâ€™s in It?

- **Data**: We use the classic MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
- **Model**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that's designed to accurately identify these digits.
- **Training**: We train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.
- **Visualization**: Plot training accuracy and loss to see how well the model is learning.
- **Saved Model**: Once trained, the model is saved so you can use it for future predictions.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning.git
    ```
    Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Go to the Project Folder**:
    ```bash
    cd Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
    ```

3. **Set Up Your Environment** (Optional, but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Project

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/digit_recognition.ipynb
    ```
    This notebook walks you through training the model and seeing the results.

2. **Train the Model**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model on the MNIST dataset.

3. **Check the Results**: Youâ€™ll find plots of training accuracy and loss right in the notebook, so you can see how the modelâ€™s performance evolves over time.

4. **Make Predictions**: You can use the trained model to make predictions on new handwritten digit images. The model is saved in `models/model.h5` for easy loading.

## Project Layout

- `data/`: (Optional) Contains the MNIST dataset if you prefer a local copy.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook for all the training and evaluation steps.
- `models/`: Where the trained model is saved (`model.h5`).
- `plots/`: Contains visualizations of training accuracy and loss.
- `src/`: Source code files that power the model.
- `.gitignore`: Files and folders to ignore in version control.
- `README.md`: Youâ€™re reading this file! ðŸ“„
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages youâ€™ll need.
